        <p class="text-center ">Node.js and Express.js are two popular technologies used in web development, particularly for building server-side applications. Here's an overview of each:

           <h2>Node.js:</h2> 
            
            Node.js is an open-source JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server-side, as opposed to in a web browser.
            It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for building scalable and high-performance applications.
            Node.js is single-threaded, non-blocking, and event-driven, which means it can handle a large number of concurrent connections without causing performance bottlenecks.
            It's commonly used for building server-side applications, such as web servers, APIs, real-time applications, and more.
        </br>
            <h2>Express.js:</h2>
            
            Express.js, often referred to simply as Express, is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of tools and features that make it easier to build web applications and APIs.
            Express simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware integration, making it a popular choice for building web applications.
            It's known for its simplicity, speed, and a vast ecosystem of middleware and extensions available, allowing developers to extend its functionality as needed.
            Express is widely used in combination with Node.js to create web servers and APIs.</p>
